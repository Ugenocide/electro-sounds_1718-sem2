# THRU Project Description:

A 3D Visual Art experience that was designed to make the viewer feel immersed into the visual and musical world through the ability of moving around a 3D space with the arrow keys on the keyboard to have multiple perspectives on the image as if you were viewing it physically in real life. I wanted to imagine the visual as if I was wearing a virtual reality goggle where I was able to fly around a space and experience music.

The concept of the main 'SuperShape' in this space was inspired by the works of Reza Ali, and also Paul Bourke for coming up with the formulas to create 2D SuperShapes.

The music you hear for the soundtrack behind THRU is composed by Eugene Soh (PandaMachine) on the MakeNoise shared system. The SuperShape reacts to the amplitude and the frequencies that come from the soundtrack to influence the overall shape and structure of the main SuperShape.

### REFLECTION

This project was a great experience for me as I explored WEBGL more in depth and was able to express myself through visual art and musicality as well. As a musician I deeply feel that these two aspects were made for each other and are very important for all musicians to have a background and knowledge of it.

I will definitely work more on visuals with music as it will aid in giving me a better identity as a musician in the years to come. Coding has also opened the world of art to me as I am not a person who can draw so being able to put the images in my mind to reality through the use of code has really made me feel closer to art.
